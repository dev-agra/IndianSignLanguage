🤟 Indian Sign Language Detection 🤟
This project uses machine learning to detect Indian Sign Language gestures in real time. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the code is written in Python. You can run the code in a Jupyter Notebook, which makes it easy to experiment with different settings and parameters.

🚀 Getting Started 🚀
To get started with this project, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and start experimenting with the code. To do this, run the following command:

jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can navigate to the sign_language_detection.ipynb file and open it.

🧠 How It Works 🧠
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning algorithm that is well-suited to image recognition tasks. The CNN is trained on a dataset of images of hand gestures in Indian Sign Language, and it learns to recognize the different gestures by analyzing patterns in the pixel values of the images.

The Jupyter Notebook includes code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the images, building the CNN model, training the model, and making predictions on new images.

🤖 Model Performance 🤖
The model achieves an accuracy of over 95% on the test set, which demonstrates its effectiveness at recognizing Indian Sign Language gestures. However, like any machine learning model, it is not perfect, and there may be some cases where it fails to recognize a gesture correctly.
